Create a new rails app that allows a customer to purchase a product.
- use mysql as your data store.
- You don't have to talk to a third party api for the purchase, but you do need to create a form that takes a fake credit card number as a form of payment
- You just need to have a view of all products (no need for product images, just titles)
- You need a view of all purchases (customer name and product, again no images)
- Just use basic styling for the app, no images, but keep things tidy.
- Add anything you feel is necessary to have a fast and safe product store.
